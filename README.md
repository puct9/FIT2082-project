# FIT2082 research project

Finding the domain of applicability of simple machine learning models (linear models and generalised additive models).

## Roadmap

The following are ideal points of progress for this project, but are unable to be acted upon due to a lack of (human) bandwidth.

- [ ] Remove PyTorch dependency in favour of lightweight NN framework such as [`tinynn`](https://github.com/borgwang/tinynn).
- [ ] Complete docstrings and documentation.
- [ ] Improve data download process.
